# CS221
This repo contains Python files that provide additional test cases for the homework in CS221.  Note that these are not the *answers* to the problems.
They just provide additional tests you can run to see if your Python functions are providing the same results as mine.

If the results of your function do not match the results of mine, do not assume you are wrong.  I'm an idiot, and there's a good chance my functions
are not right.  Where we disagree should be considered an area for further investigation, not a judgement of your code.

For each homework, just download my `jgrader.py` file and put it in your homework directory.  Then run my `jgrader.py` file just like you run
`grader.py`.
